I develop non-local integro-partial differential equations (iPDEs)
where interaction kernels $W(r,p)$ encode both spatial separation and
cellular state (such as polarization). This framework provides a
rigorous mathematical language for collective cell migration analogous
to Green's functions in classical physics.

When cells in a tissue exert traction forces, they pull on one another
and on the underlying matrix, much like a tug of war. Since cells can
extend long protrusions (over several cell diameters), such effects act
over long distances (nonlocal), and not simply by neighbour-to-neighbour
(local) contact. But most traditional continuum models (PDEs) can only
describe local interactions. I use integro-PDEs to capture these
nonlocal mechanical tissue stresses.

## The Mathematical Framework

The prototypical cell adhesion model is:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( u(x,t) \int_{-R}^{R} h(u(x+r,t))\Omega(r)\, \mathrm{d} r \right),$$

where $u(x,t)$ is the cell density at location $x$ and time $t$, $R$ the cell
sensing radius, $\alpha$ the homotypic adhesion strength, $\omega(r)$ an even
function, and $h(u)$ a function describing adhesion bond kinetics.

The initial condition is in blue (dashed), the steady state solution is in black
(solid). The remaining curves are intermediate times. A bifurcation occurs
between $\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha=10$. Numerical solution via a finite volume
scheme.

written as a "meta-theorem".

## Key Innovation: State-Dependent Interaction Kernels

By incorporating cellular polarization states into interaction kernels $W(r,p)$,
I resolve paradoxes like the "pseudo-inertia" phenomenon where cells in
overdamped environments exhibit apparent inertial behavior. This framework
enables systematic coarse-graining from cell-based models to continuum
descriptions while preserving bifurcation structures and emergent behaviors.

This approach provides a rigorous mathematical language for collective cell
migration analogous to Green's functions in classical physics, enabling
cumulative scientific progress where theoretical advances in one biological
context immediately benefit all systems sharing the same mathematical structure.

## Current Research Directions

### From Paradox to Principle

Recent experiments reveal cells exhibit apparent inertial behavior in overdamped
environmentsâ€”a fundamental paradox since Reynolds numbers $\sim 10^{-6}$ make
physical inertia negligible. My work demonstrates how polarization-position
coupling creates this apparent second-order behavior and identifies
symmetry-breaking mechanisms enabling cell entrainment.

### Rigorous Coarse-Graining
I develop systematic procedures that preserve bifurcation structure when transitioning from cell-based to continuum models, proving when polarization transport must supplement density evolution to capture collective behaviors.
