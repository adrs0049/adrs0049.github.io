I create hybrid models that embed intracellular signaling networks
(GTPases like Rac/Rho) within cell-based simulations, enabling
mechanistic connections between molecular processes and tissue-level
patterns. These models track both cell positions and internal
biochemical states using coupled ordinary and partial differential
equations.

I consider models of intra-cellular signalling in cell polarization,
that control how a cell determines its front and back. **The objective**
is to uncover how cell-cell interactions, intracellular signalling,
forces, and adhesion affect cell polarity and lead to the emergence of
collective cell behaviour, in small to large cell groups.

## The Multiscale Challenge

This challenge spans three orders of magnitude: GTPase signaling
operates over seconds and micrometers, while tissue reorganization
occurs over hours and millimeters. Current approaches face an
impossible choice: cell-based models capture biological reality but
resist mathematical analysis, while continuum models enable analytical
insights but lose essential mechanisms.

## My Hybrid PDE-Cell-Based Models

My models track 1D cells and their concentrations of intra-cellular
proteins using reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs). The proteins Rac
and Rho are known to regulate cell expansion and contraction. In my
model, their concentrations determine the forces on the cell edges.
Crucially my model accounts for single-cell experiment results.

experiment (Desai *et al.* 2013). Right: My mechanochemical model of a
1D cell has two modules: a polarization model, and visco-elastic
"spring" connecting the cell's edges. The polarization model describes
intra-cellular proteins resulting in forces on the cell's edges.

adoption to other spatial systems. **E:** Bifurcation diagram of a

constant solutions, while the others are polarized states (see **C**).

## Key Innovation: Mechanistic Rather Than Phenomenological

Rather than phenomenological rules, my models incorporate validated
molecular mechanisms (receptor-ligand dynamics, cytoskeletal
reorganization) and predict how perturbations to signaling cascades
manifest in collective migration patternsâ€”bridging three orders of
magnitude from seconds/micrometers to hours/millimeters.
