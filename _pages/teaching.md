I am passionate about teaching applied mathematics and its applications to biological systems. Below you'll find courses I've taught, along with available course materials.

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in making mathematics accessible and relevant by:

- **Connecting theory to applications** - Every mathematical concept is motivated by real-world problems
- **Active learning** - Students learn best by doing, not just listening
- **Computational tools** - Modern mathematics requires computational thinking
- **Collaborative environment** - Learning happens through discussion and peer interaction
