I am passionate about teaching applied mathematics and its applications to biological systems. Below you'll find courses I've taught, along with available course materials.

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in making mathematics accessible and relevant by:

- **Connecting theory to applications** - Every mathematical concept is motivated by real-world problems
- **Active learning** - Students learn best by doing, not just listening
- **Computational tools** - Modern mathematics requires computational thinking
- **Collaborative environment** - Learning happens through discussion and peer interaction

## Course Materials

Many of my courses include:
- **Interactive Jupyter notebooks** for hands-on exploration
- **Custom problem sets** that build from basic concepts to research-level questions
- **Open-source software** that students can continue using

## Student Research Opportunities

I regularly supervise:
- **Undergraduate research projects** (independent study, REU programs)
- **Honors theses** in mathematical biology
- **Graduate student research** in applied mathematics

Interested students should contact me to discuss current opportunities.
