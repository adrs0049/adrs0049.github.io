# Mathematical Biology Laboratory

Welcome to the Buttenschön Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst! We
use mathematical modeling and computational approaches to understand how cells
organize into functional tissues.

## Research Focus

Our lab investigates the fundamental principles governing collective cell
behavior through:

- **Nonlocal PDE models** for tissue-scale phenomena
- **Cell-based modeling** for individual cell mechanics and interactions
- **Pattern formation** in developmental biology
- **Cell migration** in wound healing, development and cancer

## Current Projects

Coming soon.

## Lab Members

### Principal Investigator
**Andreas Buttenschön, Ph.D.**
Assistant Professor of Mathematics
[andreas.buttenschoen@umass.edu](mailto:andreas.buttenschoen@umass.edu)

### Graduate Students
*Positions available - see below!*

### Undergraduate Researchers
- **Justin Steinman** (2024 REU) - First lab preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04512)

## Join Our Lab

### Graduate Students
I am actively recruiting PhD students interested in mathematical biology. Strong backgrounds in:
- Applied mathematics (PDEs, dynamical systems)
- Computational methods
- Biological sciences (complementary but not required)

are particularly welcome.

### Undergraduate Students
Motivated undergraduates can join through:
- Independent study projects
- Summer REU programs
- Honors thesis research

### Postdoctoral Fellows
Please contact me directly to discuss potential funding opportunities.

## Resources & Tools

### Software Developed
- **TDR** - Taxis-Diffusion-Reaction solver with non-local support.
- **FunPy** - [(i)PDE toolbox](https://github.com/adrs0049/funpy) for bifurcation analysis
- **AdhesionRandomWalk** - [Gillespie-SSA framework](https://github.com/adrs0049/AdhesionRandomWalk)

### Computational Resources
Our lab has access to high-performance computing resources for large-scale simulations.


## Lab Environment

We maintain a collaborative environment where ideas are shared openly and
everyone is welcome to contribute. Our weekly lab meetings provide a supportive
space for:

- Presenting research progress and getting feedback
- Discussing new papers and mathematical techniques
- Troubleshooting challenges together


## News & Updates

**October 2024**: First lab preprint posted! Congratulations to [Justin Steinman](https://nubdotdev.github.io) on his REU project.

**June 2024**: New preprint on cell cluster instability available on arXiv.

**September 2022**: Lab established at UMass Amherst.
