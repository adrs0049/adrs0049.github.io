I am an applied mathematician, building bridges between the mathematical,
computational, and biological sciences.  My strong foundations in each, allow
me to identify key biological problems, draw on and contribute to theoretical
mathematical foundations, and develop advanced computational tools.

Swarms, flocks, and human societies all exhibit complex collective behaviours. I
am interested in collective cell behaviours, which I view as swarms with a twist:
  1. Cells are not simply point-like particles but have spatial extent;
  2. Interactions between cells go beyond simple attraction-repulsion; and
  3. Cells "live" in a regime where friction dominates over inertia.

Examples include: wound healing, embryogenesis (normal development), the immune
response, and cancer metastasis. I use mathematical modelling and
computational biology to uncover the *universal principles* how biological,
physical, and chemical factors shape biological tissues.

Interactions in tissues range over several orders of magnitude in time and
spatial scales.  Distinct mathematical frameworks are appropriate for specific
levels of detail. For instance, differential equations (DEs), tracking changes in cell
(or protein) densities, are suitable for describing large populations. I use
**dynamical systems, bifurcation theory**, and **group theory** to
analyse **nonlocal** DEs. On the other hand, to track the motion, behaviour,
or forces produced by individual cells, a more detailed **cell-based
computational framework** is needed. I refer to such models as cell-based models
(CBMs).
