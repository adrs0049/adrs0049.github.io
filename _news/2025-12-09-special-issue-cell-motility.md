We invite you to submit your research to a special issue of the **Journal of Mathematical Biology** entitled "Mathematical Modeling of Cell Motility Across Scales."

Cell motility underpins critical biological processes from development to
disease, yet understanding its mechanisms requires integrating knowledge across
molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. While mathematical models increasingly
appear in experimental studies, rigorous mathematical analysis often remains
peripheral. This special collection aims to center the quantitative frameworks
that reveal organizing principles and generate testable hypotheses beyond what
experimentation alone can uncover.

**We seek contributions that:**
- Employ rigorous mathematical analysis to distinguish competing hypotheses
- Identify common mathematical structures and fundamental mechanisms across cell movement systems
- Propose theoretical frameworks that inform experimental directions
- Utilize diverse approaches including PDEs, multiscale models, stochastic processes, mechanical models, and data-driven methods

We particularly encourage focused contributions (10–25 pages) that distill key insights through systematic analysis spanning intracellular signaling, cytoskeletal mechanics, directed migration, and collective tissue dynamics.

**Submission Deadline:** June 30, 2026
