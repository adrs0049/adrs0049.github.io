## Course Description

This course introduces mathematical approaches to modeling cellular phenomena,
from subcellular dynamics to tissue formation. Students will develop skills in
formulating and analyzing mathematical models using differential equations to
understand biological systems. The course emphasizes both analytical techniques
and computational methods to explore complex biological processes such as cell
movement, signaling, and pattern formation. Through hands-on computational labs
and project work, students will gain experience implementing and visualizing
mathematical models of cellular behavior.

This course satisfies the upper-division Integrative Experience (IE)
requirement. Students will have structured opportunities to reflect on
connections between their General Education courses and the focused work in
their major, apply critical thinking to complex problems in mathematical
biology, and engage in collaborative projects addressing real-world biological
questions.

This course introduces mathematical approaches to modeling cellular phenomena,
from subcellular dynamics to tissue formation.

* Introduction to Cell Biology and Mathematical Modeling
    * Course overview and mathematical prerequisites
    * Introduction to cell structure and function
    * Dimensional analysis in biological discovery
    * Basic models for cellular processes

* Subcellular Dynamics
    * Cell structure and models for cytoskeletal assembly
    * Random walks and their applications
    * From molecular dynamics to cell shape
    * Introduction to the telegrapher equation

* Cell Polarity and Directional Movement
    * Cell signaling and biological switches
    * Mathematical models of bistability
    * Basic bifurcation theory
    * Introduction to computational models of cell behavior

* Multicellular Systems
    * Cell-cell interactions

## Project Work

A major component of this course is a final project where students will:

1. Select a biological phenomenon of interest
2. Develop appropriate mathematical models
3. Analyze the models using analytical and/or computational techniques
4. Present their findings in a written report and oral presentation

Project work includes proposal development, regular check-ins, and final
presentations in the last weeks of the semester. This project-based approach
provides students with an integrative experience that connects mathematical
theory with biological applications, encouraging creative problem-solving and
effective scientific communication.
