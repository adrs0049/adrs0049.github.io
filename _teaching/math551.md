MATH551 is an introduction to numerical analysis. The topics we will discuss are:

- **Taylor's theorem with remainder** and its use in developing numerical approximation schemes such a finite differences.
- **Round-off errors** and **condition number** with applications to the fast inverse square root used in Quake-III and Kahan summation.
- **Iterative methods** for root solving of nonlinear equations.
- **Direct methods** for linear systems.
- **Iterative methods** for linear systems.
- **Polynomial interpolation** using Chebyshev polynomials and a brief introduction to spectral methods.
