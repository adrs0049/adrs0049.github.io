* Course time: **TBA**
* Course text: [**Elements of Applied Functional Analysis**](https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~thillen/FA-book-June2023.pdf) by [Thomas Hillen](https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~thillen).
* Course notes: [**In-progress notes**](https://www.buttenschoen.ca/MATH725).

## Topics

This is a one-semester introduction to Functional Analysis: I plan to cover most of the chapters in Hillen (as time permits), as well as some uses for functional analysis in Neural Networks, and numerical tools to explore functional analysis.


* Function Spaces;
* Linear Operators and Subspaces;
* Duality;
* Sobolev Spaces and Distributions;
* Calculus: Integration and Differentiation;
* Fixed Point Theorems;
* Calculus of Variations;
* Spectral theory;
* Semigroup theory;
* Applications of functional analysis:
    * Reaction-diffusion equations.
    * Bifurcation theory;
    * Numerical tools (as time permits);
    * Neural-networks;
