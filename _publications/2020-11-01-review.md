**Abstract:** Mathematical and computational models can assist in gaining an
understanding of cell behavior at many levels of organization. Here, we review
models in the literature that focus on eukaryotic cell motility at 3 size
scales: intracellular signaling that regulates cell shape and movement, single
cell motility, and collective cell behavior from a few cells to tissues. We
survey recent literature to summarize distinct computational methods
(phase-field, polygonal, Cellular Potts, and spherical cells). We discuss models
that bridge between levels of organization, and describe levels of detail, both
biochemical and geometric, included in the models. We also highlight links
between models and experiments. We find that models that span the 3 levels are
still in the minority.
