excerpt: 'Off-lattice agent-based models (or cell-based models) of multicellular systems are increasingly used to create in-silico models of in-vitro and in-vivo experimental setups of cells and tissues, such as cancer spheroids, neural crest cell migration, and liver lobules. These applications, which simulate thousands to millions of cells, require robust and efficient numerical methods. At their core, these models necessitate the solution of a large friction-dominated equation of motion, resulting in a sparse, symmetric, and positive definite matrix equation. The conjugate gradient method is employed to solve this problem, but this requires a good preconditioner for optimal performance. In this study, we develop a graph-based preconditioning strategy that can be easily implemented in such agent-based models. Our approach centers on extending support graph preconditioners to block-structured matrices. We prove asymptotic bounds on the condition number of these preconditioned friction matrices. We then benchmark the conjugate gradient method with our support graph preconditioners and compare its performance to other common preconditioning strategies.'

This was project was started by [Justin Steinman](https://nubdotdev.github.io/) as a REU project at uMass in the summer of 2023.
In this project, Justin derives and explores graph based preconditioners for the linear systems arising from the equation of motion
in off-lattice agent-based models, such as centre-based models.


**Abstract:** Off-lattice agent-based models (or cell-based models) of multicellular systems are increasingly used to create in-silico
models of in-vitro and in-vivo experimental setups of cells and tissues, such as cancer spheroids, neural crest cell migration, and liver lobules.
These applications, which simulate thousands to millions of cells, require robust and efficient numerical methods. At their core, these
models necessitate the solution of a large friction-dominated equation of motion, resulting in a sparse, symmetric, and
positive definite matrix equation. The conjugate gradient method is employed to solve this problem, but this requires a good preconditioner
for optimal performance. In this study, we develop a graph-based preconditioning strategy that can be easily implemented in such
agent-based models. Our approach centers on extending support graph preconditioners to block-structured matrices. We prove
asymptotic bounds on the condition number of these preconditioned friction matrices. We then benchmark the conjugate
gradient method with our support graph preconditioners and compare its performance to other common preconditioning strategies.
