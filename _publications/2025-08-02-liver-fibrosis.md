**Abstract:**
We developed a digital twin model simulating septal and biliary liver fibrosis
patterns. The mechanism demonstrates that ECM distribution results from the
pattern of cell death zones and biomechanical compression due to cell
proliferation. The model integrates hepatocytes, stellate cells, macrophages,
bile duct cells, collagen fibers, and cell communication to explain how healthy
hepatocytes proliferate to compensate for losses while mechanical compression
shapes collagen distribution into characteristic wall-like structures.
