TDR Solver is a specialized finite volume solver designed for taxis-diffusion-reaction systems commonly found in mathematical biology. It efficiently handles non-local terms arising from cell-cell adhesion and long-range sensing, using the ROWMAP integrator for robust time-stepping of stiff equations.
