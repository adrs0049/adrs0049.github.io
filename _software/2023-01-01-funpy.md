## Overview

FunPy is a toolbox designed for researchers working with
integro-partial differential equations (iPDEs) in mathematical biology and
beyond. It provides a unified framework for numerical simulation, analysis, and
visualization of complex spatial models.

## Key Applications

- **Cell adhesion models**: Analyze pattern formation in tissue development
- **Bifurcation analysis**: Track solution branches and identify critical transitions

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrs0049/funpy.git
cd funpy
pip install -e .
```
